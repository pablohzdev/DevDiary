# Module 01: Introduction to Web Development 🌐

## Overview
This is the starting point of my journey. In this module, I am exploring the fundamental building blocks of the internet and setting up my professional development environment following **The Odin Project** curriculum.

In the **notes** folder, as the name suggests, you will find all the notes I've made over time, including summaries, mind maps, and more.
In **tools-setup**, I will list all the applications and extensions I have downloaded for this project.

This is not a final version; I will be updating this as I progress through the course.
