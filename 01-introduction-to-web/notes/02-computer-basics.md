## 1. What Is a Computer?

A computer is an electronic device designed to **store, process, and retrieve data**.  
At its core, a computer operates using **binary data (0s and 1s)**, which are combined and interpreted to create images, text, games, and applications.

A computer system is made up of two main components:

- **Hardware:** Physical parts you can touch
- **Software:** Instructions that tell the hardware what to do

Computers come in many forms, including personal computers, laptops, servers, and embedded systems.

---

### 1.1 Hardware vs Software

#### Hardware
Hardware refers to any **physical component** of a computer system.

Examples include:
- Monitor
- Keyboard and mouse
- Motherboard
- CPU
- Storage devices

#### Software
Software is a **set of instructions** that controls how the hardware behaves.

Examples include:
- Operating systems
- Applications
- System utilities

Hardware without software cannot function, and software without hardware cannot run.

### 1.2 Common Computer Types

#### Personal Computers
Personal computers (PCs) are designed for individual use.  
They rely on an **operating system** to manage resources such as memory, storage, and input devices.

#### Servers
Servers are computers designed to:
- Store data
- Process requests
- Deliver web pages and services to other computers over a network

Most websites and online services operate on servers.

### 1.3 External Computer Components

- **Case (Tower):** Encloses and protects internal components  
- **Monitor:** Displays visual output such as text, images, and video  
- **Keyboard & Mouse:** Input devices used to interact with the computer  

---

### 1.4 Internal Computer Components

Inside a computer, several components work together:

- **Motherboard**  
  The main circuit board that connects all components

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**  
  The "brain" of the computer, responsible for executing instructions

- **Heatsink / Cooling System**  
  Dissipates heat generated by the CPU

- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**  
  Short-term memory used for active tasks  
  Data stored here is lost when the computer shuts down

- **Storage Devices**  
  - **Hard Disk Drive (HDD):** Long-term storage using magnetic disks  
  - **Solid State Drive (SSD):** Faster long-term storage with no moving parts

- **Expansion Slots**  
  Used for components like graphics cards or network cards

- **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**  
  Converts electricity and distributes power to components

---

### 1.5 Operating Systems

An **operating system (OS)** manages both hardware and software resources.

Its main responsibilities include:
- Memory management
- Process scheduling
- File management
- Device control

Modern operating systems use a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, allowing users to interact with the system using visual elements like windows, icons, and menus.

Examples of operating systems:
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Android
- iOS

---

### 1.6 Applications & Multitasking

An **application** is software designed to perform a specific task.

- Software on desktops and laptops is called **desktop applications**
- Software on phones and tablets is called **mobile applications**

Applications run on top of the operating system.  
Most operating systems support **multitasking**, meaning multiple applications can run simultaneously.

---

## 2. Open Source vs Closed Source Software

Software can also be categorized based on **access to its source code**, which acts as a blueprint for developers.

### Open Source Software
- The source code is **publicly available**
- Anyone can inspect, modify, and contribute to the project
- Encourages collaboration and transparency

Examples:
- Linux
- Firefox
- Git

### Closed Source Software
- The source code is **not publicly accessible**
- Only the original developers or company can modify it
- Typically distributed as proprietary software

Examples:
- Windows
- macOS
- Adobe products

Most commercial software today is **closed source**, although open source software plays a major role in modern development.
