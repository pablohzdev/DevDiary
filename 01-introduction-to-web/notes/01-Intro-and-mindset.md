# Basic Preparation: Introduction & Mindset

---

## 1. Understanding the Professional Landscape

Consistency and persistence matter more than short bursts of motivation. Before diving deep into code, it helps to understand how the software industry is structured and what paths are available.

### Common Development Roles

- **Front-end Development**  
  Focuses on user interfaces, visual structure, and browser-based interactions.

- **Back-end Development**  
  Involves application logic, data handling, servers, and system architecture.

- **Full-stack Development**  
  Combines front-end and back-end responsibilities across a project.

### Typical Career Paths

- Large technology companies with complex systems and defined processes  
- Startups with fast iteration cycles and broader responsibilities  
- Freelance work with direct client ownership  
- Consulting roles focused on solving specific technical challenges

## 2. The Learning Curve: Common Stages

Learning to program often follows recognizable phases. Understanding these stages helps manage frustration and maintain momentum.

> **Conceptual reference:**  
> The following stages are inspired by Erik Trautman’s article *"Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard"*.

### Learning Stages

1. **Guided Learning Phase**  
   Progress feels fast due to structured lessons and clear instructions.

2. **Initial Confusion Phase**  
   Guidance decreases, and solving problems independently becomes difficult.

3. **Extended Frustration Phase**  
   Learners feel overwhelmed as concepts accumulate and clarity drops.

4. **Skill Integration Phase**  
   Knowledge connects, confidence grows, and building projects becomes achievable.

## 3. Mental Approach & Cognitive Performance

Your ability to manage cognitive load and frustration is a major factor in long-term success.

### Practical Learning Loop

1. Study a concept and apply it immediately  
2. Reinforce understanding by explaining it in your own words  
3. Take intentional breaks after focused effort

Struggling is a normal and expected part of learning complex systems.

## 4. Using AI Tools Responsibly

Early over-reliance on AI can limit the development of independent problem-solving skills.

### Recommended Use

- Attempt to solve problems manually before asking for assistance  
- Use AI to clarify reasoning, not to replace it  
- Review AI-generated answers critically

### Asking for Technical Help

When asking for help, always include:

- The relevant code  
- Exact error messages  
- Previous debugging attempts
