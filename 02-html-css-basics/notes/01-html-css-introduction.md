# Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: How It Works

---

## Overview

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the **fundamental building blocks of the web**.

- **HTML** puts information on a webpage.
- **CSS** controls how that information looks and is positioned.
- **JavaScript** adds interactivity and behavior.

Modern web browsers translate these languages and render them so users can see and interact with websites.  
All three technologies are constantly evolving.

## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is responsible for the **structure and content** of a website.

With HTML, you can:
- Create the basic structure of a web page
- Define headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists
- Organize content in a meaningful way

HTML alone defines *what* appears on the page, but without styling, it usually looks very plain.

Knowing HTML gives you:
- More control over your website
- The ability to modify content without relying on external tools
- A strong foundation for learning CSS and JavaScript

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS controls the **presentation and visual appearance** of a website.

CSS allows you to:
- Change colors, fonts, and spacing
- Control layout and positioning
- Make websites look modern and visually pleasing

CSS is generally considered a **styling language**, not a full programming language, and it works by applying styles to HTML elements.

Examples of what CSS can do:
- Change text color and font size
- Adjust margins, padding, and alignment
- Match the visual identity of a website to a brand

Once you understand the basics of CSS, you can significantly improve the look and feel of any HTML content you create.

## JavaScript

JavaScript adds **interactivity and behavior** to websites.

While:
- HTML provides structure
- CSS controls presentation

JavaScript controls **how elements behave**.

With JavaScript, you can:
- Respond to user actions (clicks, typing, scrolling)
- Modify content dynamically
- Control interactive features on a webpage

JavaScript is the most complex of the three technologies, but it provides powerful capabilities.

Some examples of what JavaScript can do:
- Create a calculator
- Add autocomplete functionality
- Play animations when users scroll
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for navigation

The possibilities with JavaScript are practically limitless, making it a core language for modern web development.

## How They Work Together

A complete website typically uses all three technologies:

- **HTML** → Defines the content  
- **CSS** → Styles and positions the content  
- **JavaScript** → Adds logic and interaction  

They depend on each other to create functional, visually appealing, and interactive websites.
